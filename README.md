# CVE Dataset (1999-2024) for LLM Fine-Tuning

---

## Overview

This dataset comprises **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)** records spanning from **1999 to 2024**. Each entry provides essential information on software vulnerabilities, their descriptions, affected products and versions, CVSS scores, and relevant references. The data is formatted in a **JSON Lines (.jsonl)** structure, making it suitable for fine-tuning **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for tasks such as cybersecurity analysis, vulnerability detection, and automated threat intelligence.

The dataset is prepared for use in scenarios where an LLM needs to comprehend, describe, and respond to questions about cybersecurity vulnerabilities. It leverages data from official CVE repositories, transforming it into a structured question-answer format.

## Dataset Structure

Each line in the `.jsonl` file corresponds to a JSON object with the following fields:

- **`instruction`**: The task or command for the model.
- **`input`**: The specific question or query.
- **`output`**: The response or information the model is expected to generate.

### Example Entry

```json
{
    "instruction": "Describe CVE-2021-1234.",
    "input": "What is CVE-2021-1234?",
    "output": "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in XYZ software version 1.2.3, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code."
}
```

  `"input": "Where can I find more information about CVE-2023-7890?"`

- **For publication dates**:  
  `"input": "When was CVE-2018-6543 published?"`

### `output`

The `output` field provides the detailed answer to the input query. Examples include:

- **Description**:  
  `"output": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in ABC software version 2.0, which allows remote code execution."`

- **Affected product and version**:  
  `"output": "The affected product is DEF software, version 1.5.2 and 1.6.0."`

- **CVSS score and severity**:  
  `"output": "The CVSS score and severity for CVE-2022-3456 is 7.8 (High)."`

- **References**:  
  `"output": "References are available at: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-7890."`

- **Publication date**:  
  `"output": "CVE-2018-6543 was published on 2018-03-15."`
